# HMx

This is the source code for the halo-model cross correlations tool (HMx). It is currently undergoing testing and is certainly not ready to be applied to any data analyses. However, the code is in the public domain in the hope that some parts of it may still be useful to the astronomical community.

To install you need to simultaneously download my Fortran library (https://github.com/alexander-mead/library), but you do not need to have installed the library. You simply need to point the Makefile included with `HMx` to the library location.

The construction of this code is being made possible due to funding support from the European Unionâ€˜s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 702971.
